## 🌍 Geography Quiz Web App

A progressive web project to learn the **world’s capitals and flags** — built and expanded as I learn new web technologies.

---

### 🚀 Project Vision

This app is more than just a quiz — it's a **learning showcase**. Each version of the project reflects my growth as a developer: starting with what I already knew (Python and HTML) and layering in new skills as I acquire them — from CSS, to JavaScript, to mobile-ready features.

> 🧠 The core idea: learn geography while learning to build and scale modern web applications.

### 🧽 Learning Journey & Timeline

| Stage                      | Tech Used                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Step 1**                 | `Python`, `HTML`, `Flask`           | 🌱 Initial version: display a flag, guess the capital. I only knew Python and HTML, so I had to **research Flask** and how to connect backend logic (Python) with frontend rendering (HTML). |
| **Step 2** *(in progress)* | `+ CSS`                             | 🎨 Making the app more visually appealing while learning CSS fundamentals.                                                                                                                   |
| **Step 3** *(upcoming)*    | `+ JavaScript`, `jQuery`, `Select2` | 🧠 Adding interactivity like autocompletion and enhanced forms.                                                                                                                              |
| **Step 4** *(future)*      | `+ PWA / Mobile framework`          | 📱 Turning the quiz into a responsive web app or mobile app (possibly with Flask backend + frontend JS framework).                                                                           |

Each step has its own folder inside the repo to reflect how the same app grows over time — and how my skill set grows too.

### 🎮 Features (Step 1)

* Randomly displays a country flag
* User selects the capital from a searchable dropdown (Select2)
* Flask checks the answer and shows feedback
* All capitals and flags loaded from a structured JSON dataset
* Layout responsive to user answers without page redirects

### 📚 What I Learned So Far

* How to use **Flask** to create dynamic web apps
* How to structure **Python and HTML together**
* How to manage **static assets** (flags) and **dynamic templates**
* How to use **Jinja2** to render logic in HTML
* How to integrate **external libraries like Select2**

---

### ✨ What's Next?

* Improve layout and design with CSS
* Add "guess the country from the flag" game
* Store score or quiz history per session
* Add a timer or difficulty mode
* Make the app installable on mobile as a PWA
